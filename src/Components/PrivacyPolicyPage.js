        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Welcome to the ClickSolver Partner Platform. Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information in compliance with the latest Indian data protection laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (as amended in 2025) and the relevant provisions of the Indian IT Act and cybersecurity regulations.

          Our app connects skilled workers with users for service bookings. Workers pay a commission fee using Razorpay, a third-party payment gateway. Additionally, we collect bank account details to create a fund account in Razorpay for processing cashback payouts to workers. Please note that we do not store or manage funds internally, and we do not offer financial services such as loans, banking, or investments. All financial transactions are processed externally through Razorpay.
